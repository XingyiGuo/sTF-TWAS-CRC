In our study, we included 31 normal colon tissues, 29 serrated polyps, 
29 conventional adenomas, 17 microsatellite stability (MSS), and 
15 microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

1. For absorptive cells(ABS cell), we did these comparisons:
ABS in NL vs ABS in SER,
ABS in NL vs ABS in AD,
ABS in NL vs serrated specific cells(SSC) in SER,
ABS in NL vs adenoma specific cells(ASC) in AD;

2. For goblet cells(GOB), we did these comparisons:
GOB in NL vs GOB in SER,
GOB in NL vs GOB in AD,
GOB in NL vs SSC in SER,
GOB in NL vs ASC in AD;

3. For serrated polyp specific cells, we did these comparisions:
SSC in SER vs MSI-H;
SSC in SER vs MSS;

4. For adenoma specifi cells, we did these comparisions: 
ASC in AD vs MSI-H;
ASC in AD vs MSS.
